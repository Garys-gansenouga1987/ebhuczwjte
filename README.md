OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Jumbo—I mean, seriously?? Who knew an elephant could make you feel so many feels. It's like, I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   expecting some light circus throwback, and instead, I'm in tears half the time. No one warned me, dude!

So there's this kid and the elephant, right? And it's not just any elephant, it's THE heartbreaker. I swear, Jumbo had more personality than half the performers I've worked with. No joke, if I had to pick between performing with that elephant or sticking with Tom and his juggling, I'd pick Jumbo, paws down. And that voice of the kid, kinda hit close, you know? Like when you're backstage, trying to hold it together but everything is insane?

> Anyway, you know I've been juggling (see what I did there?) 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   with all my rehearsals this week. The tightrope act needs to be less “tight” and more “hope I don’t die this time,” if you catch my drift. But who cares about all that when there's a frickin' elephant with drama skills?

And don't get me started on the circus vibes. Talk about nostalgic! Makes me wanna do some old-school moves just for kicks. The colors, the music, that whole vintage feeling—felt like I was back under the big top, when I first joined, all starry-eyed and naive. Oh, and remember that clown we cursed at every night? Chris was a real piece of work, right? Reminds me a little of the grumpy caretaker in the  , without the funny bits.

I mean, I definitely need more sleep (is there a coffee that wakes you up and knocks you out at the same time, LOL). But, seriously, if circus life were more like Jumbo’s world, maybe I'd cry less backstage. #CircusLifeDrama Maybe I'll just re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   next time I'm laid up in the trailer wishing for a hot shower.

Anyway, you gotta check it out if you haven't—it’s emotional, hilarious, insane. Makes me miss the good old days of tightropes and popcorn. Lemme know what you think if you catch it. Or maybe we can 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   together, hang out, reminisce. Like old times, yeah?
